# Game Mechanics

This section outlines the game mechanics and rules used in the Langest universe.

## Heroics

Recently, some people have begun to manifest strange abilities when faced with extreme situations, which have allowed them to perform feats impossible for a normal being. These individuals are known as Heroics.

Some Heroics can wield mystical energies and are called Emitters. The Agora institution in Puerto Mur√©n studies these abilities and teaches their use to those who possess them.

## Magical Creatures

Along with Heroics, creatures with special abilities have begun to emerge from wild areas. Some are common animals with special abilities, while others are monstrous beasts never seen before.

## System Rules

The Langest universe uses a modified tabletop RPG system designed to support the unique elements of this world, including Heroics and their special abilities.

## House Rules

Additional house rules and mechanics specific to Langest campaigns will be documented here as they are developed and refined through gameplay.
