_**After the Battle of Ajnara, the world changed like never before.**_

The Musterians, Fathers of the Dwarves, simply vanished without a trace, leaving their children to fend for themselves.

The elder elves knew of the coming and going of the ice, but they had never seen so much, nor so suddenly.

Winters became a constant blizzard. The jungles were covered by a thick, dry cloud where only cold fell. In a few years, the jungles dried up and turned into cold, barren deserts.

Ice and drought brought hunger and refugees. Vast regions were abandoned in search of the few fertile areas. Many desired what little was available, thus began a series of conflicts, civil wars, and invasions, called the Hunger Wars.

With the wars came plagues, and among these, the most feared of all, the Calcining Fever, which in a few years killed all those who used magic, suffering a long and painful illness; without magic, the world faced the rest of the plagues defenseless and great cities were left desolate by mere colds.

When the ice stopped advancing and settled, covering much of the world; between Tiblar and the Timares Mountains, _Gwaroom_ exploded, opening the earth from which gigantic rivers of liquid rock emerged. The silvery ash completely buried the remains of the Libam Empire. It erupted for 300 years, and the world was divided by the Timares Mountains.

Among the few elves that remained, the almost forgotten _Children of Queen_ reappeared, who began to age and die.

Eight thousand years have passed since Ajnara, the empires and civilizations of yesteryear lie forgotten under the ashes of time. Great battles have been fought, empires have risen and fallen under their own yoke, tyrants and saints have lived, worked, and died. While the slow and constant renewal of the ice bears witness, generation after generation, to the struggle of the peoples of L'angest to survive and prosper in the few habitable regions; always under the close watch of the Seven.

Magic, magical beasts, and heroes are found only in legends and the imagination of children… … until recently…

Recently, some people have begun to manifest strange abilities when faced with extreme situations, which have allowed them to perform feats impossible for a normal being, for this reason they have been called _Heroics_.

At the same time, creatures with abilities similar to those of the _Heroics_ have begun to emerge from the wild areas, most of them are common animals with special abilities; but some places have been ravaged by monstrous beasts never seen before, and it is on these occasions that many _Heroics_ have made a name for themselves.

Some years ago, a group of Heroics, in Puerto Murén, founded the Agora, an institution that studies these abilities and teaches their use to those who possess them, particularly those who wield mystical energies, who have been called Emitters. Graduate students are highly sought after in the most varied areas of work, paying large sums to the Agora to _reserve_ them while they train.

In a few years, the Agora has grown immensely in power, influence, wealth, and number of members, which already has several hundred students. There is already a headquarters in the Spring Capital of Ordoche and the city of Selpisy has sponsored a headquarters in that place.
