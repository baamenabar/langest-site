# Travel encounter tables

stolen from Youtube comment:

Try this. Create a 20 line table, all blank. Run your travel rules, but each time the party leaves a loose thread hanging from an event, add it to the first blank line on the table. They killed all the bandits but one? Add an assassin to the random encounter table. 

After each event roll a d20 and, if you hit a row that's not blank, run that encounter and cross it off. 

Now we have a random encounter table that's perpetually shifting and adapting to our table, but adds a level of randomness to travel that makes sense in the larger story.

# Crossbreeding accross the human species

There is no mixing of species, in most occations there is not even pregnancy, when there is it rarely comes to term, when it does, the child won't have any children of their own, even if they make it to adulthood. 

One huge exception, Humans and Orcs, it's often hard to know how pure or how mixed is a seemingly pure human or pure orc. Historically humans and elves could also have children, but after the calcine fever their ofspring were infertile.
