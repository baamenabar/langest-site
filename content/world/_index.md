# The World of Langest

_**After the Battle of Ajnara, the world changed like never before.**_

The Musterians, Fathers of the Dwarves, simply vanished without a trace, leaving their children to fend for themselves.

The elder elves knew of the coming and going of the ice, but they had never seen so much, nor so suddenly.

Winters became a constant blizzard. The jungles were covered by a thick, dry cloud where only cold fell. In a few years, the jungles dried up and turned into cold, barren deserts.
