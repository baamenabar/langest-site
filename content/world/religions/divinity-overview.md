# Divinity and religions

_There are no gods, those who have come have been expelled by mere mortals. There are only the Imnes, enlightened ones; the saints and The Seven, 7 angels with their own agenda, but they are directly related to the Imnes and the Saints._

## Main Imnes (Avatars/Gods)

### Ancient Imnes (more than 100,000 years old)

**Valaj**: Father of the Elves, the first elf, father of magic. His symbol is a tree.

**Ogankó**: Orc, father of religion and the first cities. His symbol is a wolf.

**Glavest**: Father of civilization and writing. His symbol is an Obelisk. Legend tells that he is the son of the protagonists of the epic poem Glaywe and Myraval.

**Hilhue Idaltu**: Mother of songs and sung history, she unified the halfling culture and customs, traveled the whole world teaching singing as a way of expression and learning (Idaltu means Ancient). Her symbol is a Mammoth.

**Kothi**: Kothi the weaver, in many cults she is considered the incarnation of the Great Weaver. Her symbol can be a woven basket, a woman holding a child, or a spider. She is known to have lived in Tarún (the forbidden continent to the north of the Grey Sea) only a few generations after Glavest's death.

### More recent Imnes

**Modarin**: the refugee, father of the Dwarves, rescued the dwarves from the abandonment in which the Musterian had left them when they disappeared. His symbol is a quartz crystal.

**Zícara**: Protecting godmother of the elves, after the ravages that the Calcine Fever left among the elves, she taught them the forgotten way of living in nature, taught throughout Kebara an ascetic way of life, based on vegetarianism and self-control. Her symbol is the cave bear.

## The Seven

They are seven angels who first appeared after devouring the Imne Ogankó (Valaj is an earlier Imne, but he has not been able to connect with the 7).

Angels have always rejected adoration, whenever a cult emerges to adore an angel, they will show up at a gathering, claim they are only servants.

Their names, symbols, and associated virtues or flaws are:

### Akma

Angel of Death, patroness of the undead, protector of souls. Her tool is the shovel.

Akma usually appears as a young and very attractive woman.

The Saints are declared by Akma, being present at their death, and singing at their funeral the works of this person consecrated to an Imne.

It is said that when she goes to look for someone, she says: "I come to guide you, so that you may return to the beginning." Or similar phrases.

### Bhuri

Angel of nature and hunters. His tool is the gouge.

Bhuri appears as an old centaur or a treant.

### Kineo

Angel of the sea and sailors.

His tool is the saw.

He appears as a young man who passes as a sailor.

### Orla

Angel of weather and crops.

Her tool is the scissors.

She appears as a robust middle-aged woman; in many parts, it is believed that she appears in harvest time to help collect fruit or mow grass disguised as a peasant.

### Fliin

Angel of science, magic, and art.

His tool is the pliers.

He appears as an old man with a long white beard, but his wings are the largest and strongest of all angels... He shows himself very rarely, but many feel that he is with them when they perform a great work.

### Baru or Barum

Angel of Valor, war, battle.

His tool is the scythe.

He usually appears on battlefields bare-chested to strike around (he appears as a man or woman of any race). He supports the bravest and most daring warriors. For many soldiers, shouting BARUM BARUM BARUM! before a blow is to call upon the brutal force of the Angel.
