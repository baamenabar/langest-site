## Campaign vs Adventure Modules

**Campaigns** document the actual play experiences of specific character groups, including:
- Session logs and character development
- Party dynamics and relationships
- Unique interpretations of adventure modules
- Character-specific outcomes and choices

**[Adventure Modules](/adventures/)** provide the reusable story frameworks that campaigns can engage with, including locations, NPCs, and plot hooks that can be adapted for different groups.
