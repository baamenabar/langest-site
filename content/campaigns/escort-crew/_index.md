# Escort Crew Campaign (Archived Campaign)

This campaign follows the journey of Lord Bésir, a diplomat with a short career, and his unusual escort as they navigate diplomatic missions that prove far more dangerous than anticipated.

## Campaign Overview

What began as a simple diplomatic escort mission has evolved into a complex adventure involving political intrigue, mysterious antagonists, and unexpected challenges.
