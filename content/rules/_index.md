# World Mechanics and House Rules

This section outlines the game mechanics and house rules used in the Langest campaigns.

## Heroics

Recently, some people have begun to manifest strange abilities when faced with extreme situations, which have allowed them to perform feats impossible for a normal being. These individuals are known as Heroics.

Some Heroics can wield mystical energies and are called Emitters. The Agora institution in Puerto Mur√©n studies these abilities and teaches their use to those who possess them.

## Magical Creatures

Along with Heroics, creatures with special abilities have begun to emerge from wild areas. Some are common animals with special abilities, while others are monstrous beasts never seen before.

## Other Rules

Additional house rules and mechanics will be documented here as the campaigns progress.
