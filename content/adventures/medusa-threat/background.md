# Background: The Medusa Threat

This document provides historical context and strategic analysis for the Medusa threat adventure module.

## The Medusa's Agents

Medusa is intelligent and strategic. Her agents are not simple thugs; they are extensions of her plans and fears.

### The Silent Quarrymen (Los Canteros del Silencio)

**Concept:** A group of expeditionaries, scholars and mercenaries who seek not treasures, but *knowledge*. Their mission is to loot ancient ruins and libraries in search of three things:

1. Any information about the Battle of Ajnara and the origins of the Calcining Fever.
2. Artifacts or rituals to control dragons.
3. Texts on dimensional magic or cosmic-level healing.

**How they interact with players:** The PCs might encounter them in a ruin, competing for the same artifact. Or they might discover that a sage they were going to consult has been recently "visited" by the Quarrymen, who took all his research. They are not necessarily hostile at first contact, they may try to deceive or buy the players before resorting to violence.

### The Salt Hand (La Mano Salina)

**Concept:** Medusa's spy network in port cities. They are corsairs, merchants and corrupt bureaucrats operating at the docks. Their leader is "Captain Hat" (mentioned in your original map).

**Mission:**
1. **Sabotage:** Weaken the naval defenses of Krit and Bajsa. Sink ships under construction, burn supply warehouses, etc.
2. **Intelligence:** Report to Medusa about any movement of fleets or heroes seeking to stop her. They would know that the players have sailed from Puerto Mono almost instantly.
3. **Recruitment:** Capture sailors and "offer" them to join Medusa's undead fleet.

**How they interact with players:** While the PCs travel by ship, they could be ambushed by a Salt Hand ship. Or upon arriving at a port, they might realize that someone is following them and that their plans are mysteriously leaking to the enemy.

### The Petrified Echoes (Los Ecos Petrificados)

**Concept:** Medusa's elite circle. They are not external agents, but the victims of the accident on Skull Island. Medusa has found a way to animate these statues, turning them into almost indestructible stone constructs that are absolutely loyal.

**Mission:** They are her personal guard and her "special agents." She sends them only for the most critical missions: assassinate a key target (like an admiral of the Gorilla King) or recover an artifact of utmost importance.

**How they interact with players:** A Petrified Echo would be a boss or mini-boss. They don't speak, they don't negotiate, they just fulfill their objective with terrifying efficiency. Seeing a statue move and fight would be a moment of pure horror for the players, especially if they discover that they were once people.

## The Gorilla King's Actions

The Gorilla King cannot sit idly by. He knows he is target number one and that Medusa's fleet is approaching.

### The Forge of Krit (La Forja de Krit)

**Action:** He has turned Krit into a military fortress. He has imposed a forced levy, he has put the entire population to work building scorpions, catapults and coastal walls. The island, once a place of commerce, now smells of smoke and iron.

**Consequences and Adventure Hooks:**
* **Popular discontent:** There is a faction of merchants and citizens who believe it is better to surrender. They could try to sabotage the war efforts or hire the players to negotiate with Medusa.
* **Scarce resources:** The King needs special wood for his ships and quality steel for weapons. He could hire the players to secure dangerous trade routes or to explore abandoned mines in search of veins.
* **Internal tension:** The "conflict with the Immortals" you mentioned could resurface. Perhaps the Immortals see this militarization as a threat and start causing problems.

### The Search for the "Myth-Breaker" (La BÃºsqueda del "Rompe-Mitos")

**Action:** The Gorilla King is a pragmatist. He knows he cannot defeat Medusa with brute force alone. He has sent his own agents (rivals of the PCs) on a desperate search for a weakness.

**Possible Search Objectives:**
1. **The Lost Aegis:** A legendary shield of an ancient hero that, it is said, could reflect any gaze, including that of a medusa.
2. **The Exiled Lineage:** Search for the descendants of the family that originally exiled Medusa, believing they might know a family secret or ritual to weaken her.
3. **Contact the Dragons:** If Medusa uses dragons, perhaps one can reason with them. The King could be looking for a way to break Medusa's control over the beasts or to offer them something better.

**How they interact with players:** The PCs could arrive at an ancient tomb just as the Gorilla King's agents are taking the artifact they were looking for, leading to a chase or tense negotiation.

### The Desperate Alliance (La Alianza Desesperada)

**Action:** The Gorilla King is trying to form a naval coalition. He has sent diplomats to all kingdoms, even those that already pay tribute to Medusa, with a simple message: "Today it's Krit, tomorrow it will be you. Join me or die alone."

**Consequences and Adventure Hooks:**
* **Diplomatic Missions:** The Gorilla King could learn of the PCs' mission and hire them. "Since you're going north, take this message to the King of Bajsa. Convince him to send his fleet."
* **Intrigue and Betrayal:** Medusa's agents (the Salt Hand) would actively try to sabotage these negotiations, assassinating diplomats or spreading propaganda to make the Gorilla King look weak. The players might have to protect an envoy or unmask a traitor in a royal court.
