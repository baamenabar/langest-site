# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Langest is a Hugo-based website that serves as a fictional universe/worldbuilding project. The site contains content in multiple languages (English, Spanish, and Chinese) and uses the Hugo Theme Stack for its design and layout.

## Repository Structure

- **content/**: Contains all the markdown files that make up the site content
  - Organized by categories (post, page)
  - Contains multilingual content (_index.md, _index.es.md, etc.)
- **themes/hugo-theme-stack/**: The main theme used for the site
- **assets/**: Contains images and other static assets
- **layouts/**: Custom layouts that override the theme defaults
- **archetypes/**: Templates for creating new content
- **public/**: Generated static site output (should not be modified directly)
- **resources/**: Cached resources generated by Hugo

## Development Commands

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server with draft content enabled:

```sh
hugo server -D
```

This will start a server at http://localhost:1313/ with live reloading enabled.

### Building the Site

To build the site for production:

```sh
hugo --minify
```

This generates the static site in the `public/` directory.

### Creating New Content

To create a new post:

```sh
hugo new post/my-post-name/index.md
```

To create a new page:

```sh
hugo new page/my-page-name.md
```

## Multilingual Content

The site supports three languages:
- English (default)
- Spanish (es)
- Chinese (zh-cn)

When creating content that should be available in multiple languages, create separate files with the language code in the filename:
- `index.md` (English)
- `index.es.md` (Spanish)
- `index.zh-cn.md` (Chinese)

## Content Front Matter

All content files should include front matter at the top of the file. Example:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post Title"
date: 2023-01-01
draft: false
categories:
  - Category1
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
image: featured-image.jpg
---
```

## Theme Customization

The site uses the Hugo Theme Stack with some customizations:
- Custom sidebar configuration in config.yaml
- Custom menu items for different languages
- Markdown rendering with extensions for special formatting

## Important Configuration Files

- **config.yaml**: Main Hugo configuration file
- **hugo.no.toml**: Alternative configuration file (not currently used)

## Hugo Version

The site is built using Hugo version 0.124.0 or later.

## Notes for Development

1. Always preview changes using the local development server before committing
2. Respect the multilingual structure when modifying or creating content
3. When adding new images, place them in the same directory as the content file using them
4. The site uses custom taxonomies (categories, tags) for content organization
