# Geographic highligts

Although it can't be considered a morphological continent, it is well established culturally.

**Timares Mountains:** Like all continents, Kebara underwent great changes with the arrival of the ice. The fertile plains of the north became a dry desert, with two main regions, the Aumelle Desert and the Limblar Desert. To the north, these deserts are bathed by the tempestuous Gray Sea. The south of Kebara is covered by the Great Glacier and the Mammoth Steppes. From the northeast of _Aumelle_ rise the Timares Mountains, home of the Knakam Dwarf Empire, also called _The Children of Moradin_.

**Knakam:** This is the kingdom of the dwarves, founded by Moradin himself, and in a secret place within its depths lies the pillar of Moradin, which is said to be the very body of the Imne. Passage through Knakam is strictly prohibited and punishable by death. Only with the invitation of a noble dwarf can one enter as a visitor for a few days. The dwarves have established routes through which one can access the green interior valleys. The only opportunity in which the dwarf kingdom can be openly visited is for the _Spring Concert_, an event to which all mortals are invited and is celebrated at the spring equinox, on the plateau of the Timares Mountains. This festival commemorates the day that Moradin emerged from the caverns after spending the winter locked up, to teach the dwarves the true way of life.

**The Slag:** Between the _Timares Mountains_ and the rest of the world lie the remains of _Gwaroom_, the great volcano that devastated Libam and the surrounding regions. When _Gwaroom_ became extinct, a vast region was left covered by rivers of lava that, upon cooling, turned into sharp black basalt rocks. The region is called The Slag, and it is still hot in many parts, giving off toxic vapors that are deadly to anyone who approaches... The impenetrable slag separates Kebara from the rest of the world.

**Mammoth Steppes:** A vast region of cold and dry plains, the ancestral home of the continent's halflings, occupied almost exclusively by them and glacial beasts, such as mammoths, megatheriums, woolly rhinoceroses, buffalo, cave bears, and cave lions.

**Typical Fauna:** In Kebara, the Glacial Megafauna stands out, such as mammoths, megaloceronts, saber-toothed tigers, cave lions, cave bears, cave hyenas, glyptodonts, and others... Also, in L'angest, it is the only place where there is a family of mammals, called the Buoyants, animals that float in the air as if it were water. The best known is the Levion, which is used as a mount animal. They are extremely difficult to tame and the few that exist belong to immensely rich nobles. Owning a Levion is a sign of great wealth.

**Sea of Beran:** Kebara has an intricate inland sea, which, with the arrival of the ice, was closed to the Sea of Mists. It is the only sea regularly navigated since all its coasts are close, which makes visual navigation possible, and it is not affected by the strong typhoons that hit both Fersai and the Gray Sea. The south of the Beran Sea is also known as the Glacial Sea, due to the constant presence of many icebergs that make navigation very difficult. In L'angest, navigators know how to use the stars as a guide for navigation, but the constant presence of clouds makes it impossible for long journeys.

**Natanche Region:** This is the central region of Kebara, named after the ancient Natanche Empire that encompassed the entire region. The _Natanche_ Empire collapsed during the Hunger Wars.
Currently, the region is divided into several kingdoms. In the center, in the Lacre Mountains, is the dwarf kingdom of _Debu Lec_; to the east, _Itulcia_, _Nidral_, and _Lettan_; to the west, _Natenos_ and _Gottan_; to the south, the island of Krit. The _Dwin Valley and the Tentio_ were once part of the Natanche Empire, but separated long before _Ajnara_. The region is covered by vast plains that have been used as farmland for thousands of years. The few remaining forests have been saved because they are protected for various reasons.

**Yoix:** This is a large island located south of _Krit_, home to the elves. After the _Calcining Fever_ wreaked havoc on the elves of the world, the Imne Zícara guided them to this region that had recently been devastated by a human disease. Here they developed and re-established themselves as a race. They never managed to form a single kingdom. Currently, there are a series of small kingdoms, those of North Yoix and South Yoix. Those of the north have returned to human customs, while those of the south live strictly according to the teachings of Zícara, close to nature and caring for the forests, the beasts, and all living beings.
It is from the Yoix region that the elf populations of the rest of Kebara have come.

**Quaffer:** _Trust killed Quaffer._
This was an ancient empire of men. It is said that the most beautiful men and women came from this region. For the War of Ajnara, Quaffer sent most of its troops to assist Natanche and Libam in the war, confident that the distance from the conflict would protect them. In the battle of Ajnara, demons and undead fought alongside Murral's regular troops, and the vast majority were exterminated and subsequently persecuted throughout the world. But a whole division of the army escaped all its pursuers, arriving undetected at the gates of Quaffer, taking the empire by surprise and conquering the entire region. Quaffer remains today, after 8000 years, the undead kingdom. Despite countless attempts to cleanse the area, the region remains unholy. The undead general who led his division through Kebara is the current emperor of Quaffer, the Lich Mokai, with his 3 Dukes: the vampire Sirlig, the Shadar-Kai princess Arklama, and Vispren the White Dragon. It is said that the Lich pays obedience and worship directly to Akma.

**Kaligigan:** A rich dwarf kingdom, under the Saber Mountains, is the main antagonist of Quaffer. It is the main extractor of gold from Kebara, which allows it to finance a gigantic army of elite soldiers, experts in fighting undead. The dwarves of Kaligigan are the main sponsors of the Legion of Ajnara and the Church of Plyraco.
Trabun Gile, the capital of the kingdom, the city of gold, is located under a glacier and the gigantic inner dome is covered in golden granite.

**Emik:** This is the only gnome kingdom in Kebara, located on the peninsula that extends east of the Timares Mountains and borders the slag to the north.

**Empire of Ordoche:** Currently, it is the only stable empire in Kebara. It has maintained territorial and political unity since the Hunger Wars. It is currently under the XV Dynasty of the IV Eostia. In Ordoche, the term Eostia has been coined to denote the change of the dominant race in the dynasties. For much of its history, Ordoche has been a "scattered" empire. It does not have a great historical capital. The capital has changed many times according to the ruling dynasty. Currently, there are 4 regent cities, in which the itinerant court of Ordoche settles according to the season. There is a capital for winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Ordoche is made up of administratively independent provinces or kingdoms that pay taxes to the emperor and obey the laws imposed by the empire and obey its mediations in conflicts between provinces.

**Puerto Murén:** This is the city of wonders, the largest city in Kebara with almost a couple of million inhabitants. It is a port on the coast of the Fersai Ocean that lies at the foot of the Timares Mountains. It has its own government and army, independent of the Knakam and Emik kingdoms. Despite being located at one end of Kebara, it concentrates all the trade of the continent.

**City of Selpisy:** This is the capital of Itulcia, but like its other cities, Selpisy the new, functions independently of City of the Lighthouse and Rózir. It is a city founded on the ruins of the ancient city of Selpisy and serves as a link port between Sitchia (on the other side of the Gray Sea) and the rest of Kebara, which has recently made it grow immensely.
