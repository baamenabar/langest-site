    * **Background & History**
        * Woke up a few decades ago.
        * Was asleep since before the time of "Ajnara."
        * Her ancient kingdom is now crushed beneath glaciers.
        * The family that originally exiled her no longer exists.

    * **Personality & Key Events**

        * Nature
            * Considered an immortal aberration/mutation, like an old elf
        * The Ring Incident (Key Backstory)
            * Owns a ring (likely the Antimagic Field Ring) that suppresses her petrifying gaze
            * Once, she accidentally deactivated it at a feast in her lair and petrified everyone present
            * This event likely created Skull Island and could be the source of some of her undead/statues
        * The Inaque Offensive (Campaign Catalyst)
            * 6 months ago, sacked the city of Inaque and killed the "Rabbit King"
            * Sent his head to the other kings with an ultimatum:
                * Demand 1: Pay her tribute
                * Demand 2: Surrender the Isle of Krit

    * **Primary Motivation: Fear of the "Calcifying Fever"**
        * **Core Goal:** Eliminate all outbreaks of the fever.
        * **Method 1: Dragon Control**
            * **Action:** Control dragons to burn infected cities.
            * **Tactic:** Steal dragon eggs and young to create a subservient force.
                * **Problem/Opportunity:** Some of these dragons are already infected with the Calcifying Fever.
                * **Plot Hook:** A specific "Skeletal Red Dragon" has a score to settle with another dragon in "Villa Cala."
        * **Method 2: Research & Witchcraft**
            * **Action:** Conduct experiments in a laboratory with allied witches.
            * **Objective A: Prevent Contagion**
                * **Required Tool:** An Antimagic Field.
                * **Tactics:**
                    * Search the world for Antimagic Field scrolls.
                    * Obtain a specific "Ring of Antimagic Field."
            * **Objective B: Develop a Cure/Weapon**
                * **Required Resources:** Magical components for spells.
                * **Tactic:** Work with other witches to gather components.
        * **Method 3: Strategic Alliances**
            * **Action:** Ally with the "Legion of Ajnara."
                * **Legion's Motivation:** They want to claim custody of the dragon eggs and the cities Medusa plans to... "cleanse." This is what Medusa offers them in exchange for their help.

    * **Primary Goal: Reclaim the Throne of Krit**
        * **Justification:** Krit originally belonged to her family, but it is now ruled by "King Gorilla."
        * **Current Status:** Other territories have already paid tribute to her, establishing her as a power.
        * **Primary Obstacle: King Gorilla**
            * He is the one ruler who refuses to pay her tribute.
            * **Cultural Note:** The "Gorillas" are described as misogynistic, which is a likely source of conflict with a Medusa queen.
            * **Political Complication:** King Gorilla is also in conflict with a group called "The Immortals" because he *supported* Medusa at some point. [This suggests his position is complex—perhaps he is being pressured, or he betrayed her, or public opinion is split.]
        * **Required Asset: An Armada**
            * **Component 1: Naval Force**
                * Comprised of:
                    * Corsairs
                    * Mercenaries
                    * Undead (led by a specific NPC: "Captain Hat" / "Capitán Sombrero")
            * **Component 2: Army (currently in development/questionable)**
                * Comprised of:
                    * An Undead Force (which is currently in conflict with someone named "Quaffer").
                    * Mercenaries for the main invasion.
